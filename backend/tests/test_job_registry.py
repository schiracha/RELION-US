"""
Tests for job_registry.py — the layer that turns the raw RELION-source
extraction (data/job_definitions_raw.json) into what the API/frontend use.

These are regression tests against the real extracted data (not synthetic
fixtures): the whole point of this app is fidelity to actual RELION source,
so testing against a fake/simplified job definition wouldn't catch the bugs
that matter (like the std::string("") artifact caught during development —
see data/extract_job_definitions.py's FUNC_CAST_RE).
